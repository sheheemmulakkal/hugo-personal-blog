## *Tinkerer / Developer / Film maker*

I am a software developer and love making videos.

Curiosity on how things works and expirimenting with things made me a software developer. I think tinkering with softwares are the cheapest one than building things with materials.

After dropping B.com — I was not interested learning stuff without any real experience or at least labs for expirimenting. That never motivated me. — I started learning Photoshop and designed posters for friends. Finding out you don't need a CS degree to build a software was a game changing moment.Started with learning HTML through youtube and built my own website using HTML, CSS and Javascript ( JS used to open and close modals ). Hosting a static website with a standard .com domain gave me extra boost. 

Learning a technology without having any basics, mentor or friends was kind of challenging. Joining [Brototype](https://www.brototype.com/) gave me good exposure and surrounded with like minded people who wants innovage, grow, explore.

Currently working as Web developer at [Dignizant Technologies LLP](https://dignizant.com/) since 2024.

Film making and photography brings little of my art side. Not a professional, but capturing moments and giving some kind of visual treats for others hits different.

I'll try to share my thoughts or learning through this website.
